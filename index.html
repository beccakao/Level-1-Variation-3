		<h1>I know why the caged bird sings</h1>
		<h3>Maya Angelou</h3>
		<p>
		A free bird leaps on the back Of the wind and floats downstream Till <br> the current ends and dips his wing In the orange suns rays And dares <br> to claim the sky. But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage Can sel<br>dom see through his bars of rage His wings are clipped and his feet ar<br>e tied So he opens his throat to sing. The caged bird sings with a fearf<br>ul trill Of things unknown but longed for still And his tune is heard o<br>n the distant hill for The caged bird sings of freedom. The free bird th<br>inks of another breeze And the trade winds soft through The sighing t<br>rees And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright Lawn and he names <br>the sky his own. But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams His <br>shadow shouts on a nightmare scream His wings are clipped and his f<br>eet are tied So he opens his throat to sing. The caged bird sings with A <br>fearful trill of things unknown But longed for still and his Tune is hea<br>rd on the distant hill For the caged bird sings of freedom.
